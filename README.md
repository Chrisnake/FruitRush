# Summer 2018 Project 3: FruitRush
I am currently developing another 3D based game on Unity (using C#) called FruitRush, which is an arcade game where the user must eat all the fruits on the table whilst evading an enemy orange that is chasing them in a specific amount of time. Each collectible has different properties where:

### Orange - Extra Points 
### Banana - Banana Boost
### Watermelon - Unkillable
### Lemon - Extra Time

I have also implemented levels where the environments change to increase the difficulty. The orange enemy is capable of eating the users fruits and if they do manage to eat a fruit then they increase in size, thus the more fruits the enemy takes the bigger they get and the higher the chances of them hitting the user. The user gets 3 lives and colliding with the enemy reduces one of their lives.
