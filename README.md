# Summer 2018 Project 3: FruitRush
I am currently developing another 3D based game on Unity (using C#) called FruitRush, which is an arcade game where the user must eat all the fruits on the table whilst evading an enemy orange that is chasing them in a specific amount of time. Each collectible has different properties where:

### Orange - Extra 200 Points 
### Banana - Banana Boost
### Watermelon - Extra 1000 Points
### Lemon - Extra Time

I have also implemented 15 levels where the environments change to increase the difficulty. The orange enemy is capable of eating the users fruits and if they do manage to eat a fruit then they get larger and the game ends. The user must therefore learn how to position their character to ensure the enemy does not eat the fruit. Each user gets 3 lives and colliding with the enemy also reduces one of their lives.
